What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 
You create the hidden files so that git knows its a repository. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 
The staging area is a temporary space that we can place 1 or more files in to create a commit. It takes files from the working directory and groups them logicly before adding them to the repository. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use the git diff --staged command to see the difference between the staged file and the last commit file. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help? 
While working on new or different features that you werent sure you wanted to keep or if they would work at all using branches to seperate those out into a different branch so you could work on them would make it easier to concentrate on one feature or another.
