What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 
You create the hidden files so that git knows its a repository. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 
The staging area is a temporary space that we can place 1 or more files in to create a commit. It takes files from the working directory and groups them logicly before adding them to the repository.
